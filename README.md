## 🌟 About the Project

**Floating Notes** is a visually engaging prototype where cards "float" and bounce on screen. You can **manually add cards via code**, and once they appear, they:

- 🧲 Bounce with playful physics  
- 🖱️ Are draggable anywhere in the window  
- 🎨 Act as a canvas for future productivity features  

It's currently a **visual prototype**, but it’s a living project — more features like note editing, saving, and multi-device sync are on the way.
